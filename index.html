            <h1>"On Beginnings" </h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.  </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.
              Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end. 
              </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page,  </p>
            <br>
            <h4>but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.</h4>

              <div class="note"> “the opening line of a poem, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall."

            <br>
              <p>  somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.</p>
